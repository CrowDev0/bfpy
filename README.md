## Installation from source code
1. Download/Clone the source code

3. Either "compile" it by yourself, its easy ([here](#compiling)) or download python and run the python file

## "Compiling"
1. Download the source code
2. Download [python](https://python.org/) if you haven't already
3. Run `build.bat` or `build.sh` (depending on your operating system) in build-scripts
